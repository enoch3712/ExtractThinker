# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-06-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made in this project to ensure that future contributors understand the reasoning behind key choices and can maintain consistency as the project evolves.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), following the format described by Michael Nygard in [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html).

## Consequences

- All significant architectural decisions will be documented in the `adr/` directory.
- Each ADR will have a unique number and a clear title.
- ADRs will be kept under version control.
