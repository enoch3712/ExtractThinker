                Here are some examples:

                Example 1:
                Original text:
                John Smith lives at 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001. His phone number is (555) 123-4567.

                Placeholder list:
                [PERSON1]: John Smith
                [ADDRESS1]: 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001
                [PHONE1]: (555) 123-4567

                Masked text:
                [PERSON1] lives at [ADDRESS1]. His phone number is [PHONE1].

                Example 2:
                Original text:
                Sarah Johnson ordered a laptop from TechStore on 2023-05-15. Her email is sarah.j@email.com.

                Placeholder list:

                Give me the placeholder list with the value and respective placeholder, and then the Masked text with the placeholders.

                Convert the following masked texts and placeholder lists into a JSON format. For each example, the JSON should have two main keys: "mapping" (a dictionary of placeholders and their original values) and "masked_text" (the text with placeholders).
                Always use [], not "" or ''
                Make sure that masked_text contains no sensitive information, only the placeholders.

                Example 1:
                Placeholder list:

                Masked text:
                [PERSON1] lives at [ADDRESS1]. His phone number is [PHONE1].

                Output:
